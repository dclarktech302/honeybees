          <p className="mt-6 text-lg text-muted-foreground">
            HoneyBee Designs started as a passion project and grew into something
            sweeter — a boutique sublimation merch brand committed to color,
            quality, and creativity.

            What started in a small home studio — a single heat press, a handful of
            test shirts, and a whole lot of trial and error — has grown into a
            thriving made-to-order brand. We believe that what you wear should be
            as unique as you are, and sublimation printing makes that possible with
            colors that simply don&apos;t fade.

          <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-8 text-muted-foreground">
            Every design in our catalog is original artwork, crafted in-house. We
            collaborate with local artists, take custom commissions, and welcome bulk
            orders for teams, events, and businesses. If you can imagine it, we can
            print it.
